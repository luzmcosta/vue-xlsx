# XLSX Made easy

Forked from vue-xlsx to 1) resolve security concerns by upgrading dependencies, and 2) resolve compatibility issues with the latest versions of the xlsx and vue-xlsx packages.

This library is a Vue wrapper for the excellent: [sheet-js](https://github.com/SheetJS/js-xlsx) The aim of this library is to provide an easy to use, well documented way to parse and create spreadsheets in vue.
